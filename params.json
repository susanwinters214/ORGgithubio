{"name":"Susan Winters' GitHub Website","tagline":"Never Stop Learning","body":"### Welcome to my GitHub Website.\r\nOne evening I stumbled across an article that explained how to create a web page on GitHub so I decided to give it a try. At this point I'm just discovering what's possible and playing around with the automatic page generator and taking notes of how I did this. \r\n\r\n### How to Create Your Own Github Website\r\nGitHub has an automatic page generator that allows you to type your content in a big textbox [using GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Using the Automatic Page Generator\r\n1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.\r\n2. In the repository's right sidebar, click the Settings icon.\r\n3. Click the Automatic Page Generator button.\r\n4. Write your content in the editor box.\r\n5. Click the Continue to Layouts button.\r\n6. Preview your content.\r\n7. Publish your page.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n Have fun exploring!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
